# CyChat
###### Designed for Software Engineering Fall 2022 SHSU

#### The purpose of CyChat is to provide users a secure way to create a peer-to-peer chat connection to one another by enabling users to select different encryption algorithms, making it harder for attackers to track the currently used algorithm, thus making it more difficult to break encryption. Because it is a peer-to-peer chat software, there is no database used which reduceds if not eliminates the risk of information leakage and personal information being hacked.
