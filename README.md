######Designed for Software Engineering Fall 2022 SHSU

##The purpose of CyChat is to provide users a secure way to create a peer-to-peer chat connection to one another by enabling users to select different encryption algorithms, making it harder for attackers to track the currently used algorithm, thus making it more difficult to break encryption
